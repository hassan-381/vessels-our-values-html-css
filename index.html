          <h2>About the Founder</h2>
          <p>
            Vessels embodies what I needed during my battle with anxiety and
            deep depression years ago—a brand that understands your process to
            wholeness. Through self-inquiry, I've realized the profound power of
            inner healing and realized, in the universal truth of oneness. I'm
            deeply passionate about sharing the NOW Method with the world. Now,
            as a Meditation teacher, Breathwork Facilitator and Integration
            Coach, I aim to hold space for others as they discover this truth
            within themselves. Acknowledging the self, plant medicine,
            meditation, fasting and breathwork have been pivotal in my personal
            journey, and I believe in their potential for global healing.
